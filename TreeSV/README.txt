IMPORTANT: INSTALL ALL NECESSARY PACKAGES BEFORE RUNNING


I recommend using Anaconda, it should have all the packages needed.

Install Anaconda for Python 2.7 (this script is written in Python 2.7)

You can find detailed installation instructions here: 

Mac:
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install-macos.html

You may also perform a command line install with the command: 
bash Anaconda2-4.3.1-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
(Note: Must be in TreeSV folder)

Windows:
https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install-windows.html

**************************************************************************************

HOW TO USE (mac):

1. Put TreeSV folder onto your desktop.

2. Open a command line window and navigate to the TreeSV directory.
   This can be done with: 
   cd ~/Desktop/TreeSV

3. Once in the TreeSV folder, use the command:
   python TreeSV.py
   to run the code. If you receive an error message saying that a module cannot be 
   imported,check the TROUBLESHOOTING.txt file for tips on how to resolve this. 

4. The code should launch an internet window and ask for you to login with Google.
   ***This is a secure login through Google and can be trusted***

5. Back in the command line the code will prompt you to enter the name of a directory 
   that you would like to use for your CSV. (Be careful! It’s case sensitive)
 
6. The generated CSV will appear in the TreeSV folder.
